To do, 

currently no way to introduce time in to memories i,e tomorrow i need to do something, or What do i need to do tomorrow.

plugins should be able to be chained together, i.e, if the user says "Tomorrow i need to do something" the plugin should be able to say "Ok, i will remind you to do something tomorrow" and use the date/time plugin to get tomorrow date, and then store the date in the memory using the memory plugin.
